# Dataset Package:


This is a dataset for the paper **Why Reviewers Link Between Patches?-Linked Patches as Indicators for Team Awareness during Code Review Discussions**.//
This artifact is a repository consisting of (a) dataset including (i) RQ1 dataset (ii) RQ2 dataset and (iii) RQ3 dataset and (b) script for the evaluation model.

## Abstract:
Due to the asynchronous nature of contemporary software code review tools, there is a risk of spending unnecessary efforts by developers who are unaware and lack prior knowledge on a submitted patch.
To mitigate this efficiency risk, reviewers raise awareness of related patches by posting links to another patch during a code review. However, such a practice of raising awareness and how it impacts the review process remains largely unexplored.
To fill the gap, we perform a qualitative study to (i) categorize team awareness, (ii) investigate the activities and coordination that may occur after team awareness of the patch and, (iii) analyze the timings and origins of these awareness.
Through a manual analysis of 592 patches with 750 links in the OpenStack project, we find that the awareness category of patches containing background knowledge accounts for the majority (65\%).
Developers are more likely to coordinate when linked, with 66\% of patches having coordination activities on the other linked patch after awareness.
In relation to the timings, awareness is typically raised  five days after a patch is created, and the time when a patch is submitted does not impact its awareness.
