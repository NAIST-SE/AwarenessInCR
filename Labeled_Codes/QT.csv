Technically speaking, http://doc.qt.io/qt-5.6/qstyle.html#drawPrimitive says these primitives *do* use just a QStyleOption.

So the version == 0 should be fixed, yes, but QStyleOption could still be used, maybe?

> Would the new QtLite mechanism be an option here, in order to turn this feature on and off while building?

It seems http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qsqldatabase.html#setConnectOptions is used to tweak driver-specific options. In case of QSqlLite we currently support:

QSQLITE_BUSY_TIMEOUT, QSQLITE_OPEN_READONLY, QSQLITE_OPEN_URI, QSQLITE_ENABLE_SHARED_CACHE, ISC_DPB_LC_CTYPE and ISC_DPB_SQL_ROLE_NAME

In spirit of that maybe it would make most sense to introduce e.g. a SQLITE_REGEXP and then allow to enable regexp with something like SQLITE_REGEXP=1? 

Also seems some Linux-distributions do provide an optional ""sqlite_regexp"" package ( http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5071601/how-do-i-use-regex-in-a-sqlite-query ) what in turn means (imho) that its even more important to not change the default behavior and make this opt-in (default of SQLITE_REGEXP=0) so existing code keeps on to behave exact like before.

@Giuseppe D'Angelo

What do you think? Would that be acceptable?

> Or create as static and use QRegularExpression::setPattern.

That review-comment from Jesus Fernandez against patchset #1 wasn't really addressed. I guess the reason why this was raised is that creating and throwing away a QRegularExpression for each single call to REGEXP is very expensive. More so because that can happen a lot because SQLite does that for every single row/column/entry.

From reading https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/create_function.html I wonder if this could be easy optimized by not only passing the xFunc in but split this into xFunc (which does the expensive QRegularExpression().setPattern initializing), remember that in the aApp voidstar and in xStep only do the actual match.",1001480,http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qsqldatabase.html#setConnectOptions,doc.qt.io,API documentation,Clarifying,Internal,QT

Thanks for your offer, Samuel!

Have a look at my deferred changes: https://codereview.qt-project.org/#/q/owner:jksh+status:deferred,n,z -- I hope the commit messages and Gerrit comments explain my rationale clearly enough. I haven't touched those in years though, so merge conflicts are likely. It might be easier to abandon those patches and start new ones.

Minor changes are OK to go into Qt 5.11.x, but I think major changes like renaming or removing pages should wait until Qt 5.12. These break external links so we should check with the doc team how to handle them.

Also, the Worker Object example at https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qthread.html seems a bit convoluted.

I can't comment on your customer relations or budgets, I can only comment on what makes sense for the Qt project.

I agree about having FreeType as an _option_ on OSX being a worthwhile goal, I just want to make sure we add it knowing what the way forward is, and with as minimal impact as possible on maintenance. For example, I've now discussed a bit with Eskil here in Oslo, and we've agreed that font config support is not a part of this, nor should it be, so the part of http://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-42839 that discusses font config is not in scope for any of this.

That means the approach of the CoreText font database spawning Free Type font engines makes sense. The question then is how this is done code-wise, and I need to look at the code in more detail to understand how the patch works, but my gut instinct is that the parts would fit better as runtime-checks inside the existing CoreText font database.

You mention font stored in Qt resources, is this a problem for the regular CoreText font database + font engine combo? Or for font config + freetype? I suspect it should be split out in a separate patch?

I think we need a proper cross platform solution for this. Currently it looks more like a hack that fixes the issue for Windows-only. X11 and macOS has the same issue. Instead of updating QGuiApplicationPrivate::mouse_buttons directly from platforms plugin we need to extend QWindowSystemInterface::handle{Drag,Drop} to include mouse/keyboard button state. This way all plugins will be enforced to do the right thing. Otherwise how can a plugin writer be aware of this internal Qt Gui detail (from qguiapplication):

QPlatformDragQtResponse QGuiApplicationPrivate::processDrag
QDragMoveEvent me(p, supportedActions, dropData,
                      QGuiApplication::mouseButtons(), QGuiApplication::keyboardModifiers());

QPlatformDropQtResponse QGuiApplicationPrivate::processDrop
    QDropEvent de(p, supportedActions, dropData,
                  QGuiApplication::mouseButtons(), QGuiApplication::keyboardModifiers());

Also updating ::mouse_buttons like this is really not what the documentation states:

""Returns the current state of the buttons on the mouse. The current state is updated syncronously as the event queue is emptied of events that will spontaneously change the mouse state (QEvent::MouseButtonPress and QEvent::MouseButtonRelease events).""

According to my understanding the only place that should be allowed to change the value of ::mouse_buttons is QGuiApplicationPrivate::processMouseEvent.

QGuiApplication::mouseButtons() in general is not a very useful API. I am currently looking into https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-33161 that is why I ended up on this gerrit change :)

The issue with other platforms is that QGuiApplication::mouseButtons does not contain the current mouse button state when drag operation originates from a non-Qt process.",1000207,https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-33161,bugreports.qt.io,Bug report,Clarifying,Internal,QT

If X11/XInput2/whatever does not have API for this, and there are no other ways to get a reliable value by lower level APIs then we should stop guessing and maybe unconditionally set ""rawDeltas"", without checking the increment.

https://codereview.qt-project.org/#/c/107466/12/tests/auto/corelib/serialization/qcborstreamreader/tst_qcborstreamreader.cpp line 194.

It was working when I wrote as QString. The moment I changed to QStringView, it broke. Therefore, QStringView API is flawed and needs to be fixed.

Sure, this is new code and I could simply do the calculation myself prior to calling the incoming function. The problem is changing existing code from QString to QStringView, which I assume is your intent. Since the asserts disappear in release builds, that would lead to bugs in production code, buffer overruns. That's not acceptable.

That's why this patch must go in. The API as it currently stands is flawed.",1000329,https://codereview.qt-project.org/#/c/107466/12/tests/auto/corelib/serialization/qcborstreamreader/tst_qcborstreamreader.cpp,codereview.qt-project.org,Code,Clarifying,Internal,QT

-1 because of no autotest (there's already one which can be adapted).

In general, I think the problem you're trying to fix (please correct me if I got this wrong) is the emission of selectionChanged/currentChanged with old and new indices belonging to different models.

IMHO this should be expected and documented. This allows a user listening to those virtuals to correctly track what the selection is at any given point in time, and the virtual calls are always consistent.

In other words, calling IS a set of indexes, given a series IS[0] ... IS[N] of N+1 of consecutive selections applied to the view, then the view will call selectionChanged N  times carrying the pairs IS[i], IS[i+1]. This will be done even if for some k IS[k] and IS[k+1] belong to different models.

(Mutatis mutandis for the current index)

On the other hand, with this patch, the series of will be 

..., (IS[k-1], IS[k]), (QModelIndex(), IS[k+1]), ...

conceptually (again, IMHO) breaking the semantics of a changed method which carries old and new values, which nows sees a new ""wild"" value.


Now the problem I *do* see is that my semantics are not actually expected from Qt own views, and there are bugs lingering there. For instance,

https://code.woboq.org/qt5/qtbase/src/widgets/itemviews/qabstractitemview.cpp.html#3614

expects ""previous"" to be an index handed out by d->model (wrong!) and that a row comparison is possible against current (wrong if they belong to different models!). OTOH, this very patch will also break the update logic, as handling out an invalid previous index won't cause an update for its visual region, leading to visual glitches.",1000548,https://code.woboq.org/qt5/qtbase/src/widgets/itemviews/qabstractitemview.cpp.html#3614,code.woboq.org,Code,Elaborating,Internal,QT

Did you find other issues with this approach or is this based on my comments in https://codereview.qt-project.org/#/c/127010/ ? 

If this fixes an actual bug (QTBUG-48556) then we should leave it in if it's considered critical for 5.5.1 (I can't say if it is). I just want this to be the final fix to the issue, so it should not be merged to 5.5 and 5.6/dev.

b8e0f7cfc638 fixes QTBUG-48556, which was a regression after fixing in QTBUG-46552 in 378e26dd14df, which itself was a regression after fixing QTBUG-43857 in a4c837b3a116.

Radio buttons are visible in place of chackboxes now, but they are still out of sync with widget menu/qaction, so it is possible to select many radio buttons together. I think that it should be fixed here: https://codereview.qt-project.org/#/c/146951/5 , because Android platform menu also shows checkboxes, but they are properly synced to widget menu/qaction.

When configure runs quake to build the tests, the setup is not complete and in particular QT_CONFIG does not contain no-pkg-config so if it's your path (via homebrew or macports) the test will use it, find libpng on the system and decide to use it. But when you get to build qt, it will fail to find png (correctly, should not rely on brew or ports installed stuff)

Solution is for configure to pass no-pkg-config to qmake when building tests.  There's a patch that does that, but it relies on one of your patches that does not integrate (some red hat issue I think).

Meanwhile, this change reverts the breaking change.

This has immediate benefits, see e.g:

Mouse handling has been somewhat ignored for a long time, instead of fixing things properly we have been ""stabilizing this or that test and then few weeks later blacklisting the same tests because they are unstable"") and this patch actually makes things work.

And all these QTest::mouse* APIs can coexist. This coexistence works better in dev branch as that is where https://codereview.qt-project.org/#/c/193415/ and related patches went in. Actually in dev branch these API work completely independently. In 5.10 and below, each subsequent test function uses mouse_buttons in whatever state it was left by the test functions that run earlier (deducing incorrect mouse event types). So adding this code-path won't make the broken functionality of ""mouse button deduction worse"" in 5.10 and below. It is already broken. Using QTestPrivate::mouse*() overloads has several benefits - see the commit message.

The option of fixing QTest::mouse() directly would result in behavior changes, which would brake not only our tests, but also for everyone else who uses that qtestlib API:

- not all passed in widgets would return valid window in ""widget->window()->windowHandle()"".
- refactoring case MouseMove: QCursor::setPos(widget->mapToGlobal(pos)); to wait for pos to change could result in unexpected side effects for users.
- replacing ""!qApp->notify(widget, &me)"" with proper QWindowSystemInterface API could result in unexpected side effects for users.

Also this code path will go away, once we are done porting our tests. Simple grep command can replace all QTestPrivate::mouse* with QTest::mouse* when the time comes.",1000207,https://codereview.qt-project.org/#/c/209925/,codereview.qt-project.org,Patch,Clarifying,Internal,QT

> This patch is fixing a p2, hence the reason for 5.11

Nice that it fixes things. But with reverting I was referring to the patch that you are building on top off https://codereview.qt-project.org/#/c/227104/

Porting the whole plugin I think would solve even more bugs. I tried to suggest that already here https://codereview.qt-project.org/#/c/227104/3//COMMIT_MSG

It feels a bit too late to move the whole plugin to the new API in 5.11, and having some parts using new and some parts using the old API in Cocoa I think might cause some other issues.

Linux is using the new API in 5.11. Windows went for 5.12 instead. Cocoa I think needs to choose, do all in 5.11 or do all in 5.12. The issue has been there since 5.7, perhaps delaying a fix to 5.12 is not too bad.",1000207,https://codereview.qt-project.org/#/c/227104/,codereview.qt-project.org,Patch,Clarifying,Internal,QT

Thanks for your offer, Samuel!

Have a look at my deferred changes: https://codereview.qt-project.org/#/q/owner:jksh+status:deferred,n,z -- I hope the commit messages and Gerrit comments explain my rationale clearly enough. I haven't touched those in years though, so merge conflicts are likely. It might be easier to abandon those patches and start new ones.

Minor changes are OK to go into Qt 5.11.x, but I think major changes like renaming or removing pages should wait until Qt 5.12. These break external links so we should check with the doc team how to handle them.

Also, the Worker Object example at https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qthread.html seems a bit convoluted. What do you think of removing the Controller::operate() signal and use QMetaObject::invokeMethod() to start Worker::doWork()?",1002192,https://codereview.qt-project.org/#/q/owner:jksh+status:deferred,codereview.qt-project.org,Patch,Clarifying,Internal,QT

Nice that it fixes things. But with reverting I was referring to the patch that you are building on top off https://codereview.qt-project.org/#/c/227104/

Porting the whole plugin I think would solve even more bugs. I tried to suggest that already here https://codereview.qt-project.org/#/c/227104/3//COMMIT_MSG

It feels a bit too late to move the whole plugin to the new API in 5.11, and having some parts using new and some parts using the old API in Cocoa I think might cause some other issues.

Linux is using the new API in 5.11. Windows went for 5.12 instead. Cocoa I think needs to choose, do all in 5.11 or do all in 5.12.

@Thiago/all - I'm not familiar with this code, so I will let BogDan speak to the implementation.  I can speak to our need for it in Qt Remote Objects, though, which is why we asked KDAB to look at this enhancement.  We use Q_GADGETs for sending structs in signals/slots, or as property values.  However, we hit an issue when we try to use them dynamically on the receiving side: since the metaobject system of a separate device or process doesn't know about the type, it can't decipher it.

We need a way to dynamically register Q_GADGETs.  But there isn't a single constructor we can point to (without additional information) that can construct the right properties for a Q_GADGET that is defined at runtime.  By passing the type to the constructor, we have additional information, so the static/single constructor can lookup the given types properties.  Again, see the QtRO change (https://codereview.qt-project.org/#/c/237450) for an example of usage.

Put another way, this change allows us to have a single constructor that supports a class of types (Q_GADGET, specifically), by providing the type to the constructor.

For Q_GADGET, we don't need a typed destructor.  I'm not sure if there are other use-cases that might, I think that is a great question.",1003336,https://codereview.qt-project.org/#/c/237450,codereview.qt-project.org,Patch,Elaborating,Internal,QT

QVERIFY(w.stateInMouseMove == (Qt::LeftButton | Qt::RightButton));

The change that you have done here would be ok (after the cleanups that I mentioned above) if we are ok with QCursor generated mouse events not including the state that is explicitly set by QTest::mouse API. Not sure if there is a valid use case for carrying this state with mocked mouse events.

@ossi: by dump I take it that you mean QMAKE_BUNDLE_DATA should only copy files verbatim into the bundle? That is not the case, xib files will be compiled, png's compressed etc (ref also https://codereview.qt-project.org/#/c/97868/). Even adding asset catalogs will result in icons being copied into the bundle with correct naming instead of the catalog itself. Xcode contains a whole set of rules that will apply to files added with QMAKE_BUNDLE_DATA. Files will also be end up at different places depending on which platform you're on. And we don't document this either. Setting up Xcode to use bundled asset catalogs will therefore not change much with regards to making fun of the user.

Also note that when I talk about a cross-platform way of specifying app icons, I'm not referring to qmake. We need a qt_manifest or similar that is not coupled with the build system. We had a meeting about this at contr. summit 2013, where Fawzi agreed to investigate. The point is, this WILL be done. But right now (AFAIK) its up in the air who will do it, and when.

Any opinion here by the maintainers?

The problem currently is that mouse handling in QGV does not work with non-translation type transforms due to mapTo/Back not being symmetrical.

Alternatives are:

- Push this revert for 5.5.2 and tell to people to map to embedded parent first for child hierarchies as workaround when mapping coordinates

- Leave 5.5 as is and push https://codereview.qt-project.org/#/c/144753/ for 5.6 (hopefully fixing it for good)

- Backport https://codereview.qt-project.org/#/c/144753/ for 5.5 (probably including https://codereview.qt-project.org/#/c/141859/ )

""Launching"" a bundle? Is there anything in Qt to do that? You're right that it'd be different for those applications that don't accept arguments passed on via the traditional argc,argv way, but then again you don't usually need to find the app bundle first. I'm tempted to say that launching a bundle is something that would be more at its place in QDesktopServices or QtMacExtras and that a dedicated `findAppBundle()` function could just as well be in the same class.
(cf. https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreservices/launch_services and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27303359/lsopenapplication-deprecated)

For applications that accept standard arguments (most Qt apps would be in that category I guess) you could still use `QSP::findExecutable(""foo.app""[,path])` provided it returns the path to the bundleexec or there is an additional function which returns that information.

AFAIK a thread becomes signalled when it has finished executing, regardless of the mechanism which caused it to finish.

This problem is for a very long time, since Android 5.0 when I wrongly thought that they forbid the linker to load .so files from other packages locations (check https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=79478). Of course google's engineers where not smarter than me and they thought the same thing :).  

Instead the problem is that libqtcore.so has a JNI_OnLoad which must be called from Qt's java delegate class loader. All the Qt libs are loaded from that loader, but not the application itself, which is called from the main class loader (http://code.qt.io/cgit/qt/qtbase.git/tree/src/android/java/src/org/qtproject/qt5/android/bindings/QtLoader.java#n242) This means that every time when you load the application .so file, libqtcore.so returns an error from JNI_OnLoad, which for Ministro based apps is fatal.

Well, XCB 1.12 already happened!

There seems to be ongoing work on XInput support by Christan Linhart: https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xcb/2017-January/author.html

So I cannot really answer the question. I would suggest asking on the XCB mailing list and/or asking Christian Linhart <chris@DemoRecorder.com> directly (my impression and ""git shortlog -sn src/xinput.xml"" says that he does most of the work here).

Taking by value means you transparently support move semantics. If I take it by const-&, I cannot add an overload taking &&, because it can't be inline, yet C++11 and C++98 builds need to be BC (which I think is a mistake, just saying that if you want to use C++11, you should have compiled Qt with C++98, everything else isn't supported by the compiler anyway).

Taking rvalues, however, is what this patch is all about, since {} will produce a temporary QList, and yes, addOptions() has the same problem.

> > It's pointless to do foreach opt

> Why? You can even make this constructor call addOptions

Why have it as a constructor argument if you don't take advantage of the fact that the object is uninitialised. As you can see, I'm even ashamed of having addOptions() call addOption(), because addOptions(size N) should be faster than N x addOption(), to compensate for the overhead of adding the options to a container first. Just moving that option list into the member optionList, assuming everything is ok and then checking whether it actually is is the least that a ctor taking a list of options should deliver.

> Anyway, this is outside of the scope of this patch anyway.

Agreed.

The cases are QString(""Hello""), and QString str(""hello""), because the QString ctor is explicitly invoked. Actually, for precisely this reason, it doesn't even matter whether QString(std::string) is explicit or implicit. It's enough that std::string(const char*) is implicit, which is one of the reasons why I advise everyone not to use direct initialisation with single-argument constructors: http://marcmutz.wordpress.com/2010/08/24/a-case-against-direct-initialisation-%E2%80%94-the-sequel/

> > no implicit conversions when a memory allocation is involved, which is the case here.

> Where does this rule come from? Most of the classes allocate memory and yet have implicit constructor. Remember we are doing an API that need to be easy to use and hard to use wrong. an explicit constructor here would make it easier to use properly. And constructing a QCOmmandLineOption is not performance critical.

Thiago -2'ed the QStringRef::operator QString() for that reason.

> Also, based on this argument, even the one with multiple parametter should be explicit.

No, because multi-arg implicit ctors can only be invoked with {initializer lists}. Thus their use is visible in the code, albeit not the type they convert to. Noone who reads {0, 1} can misunderstand this as not creating some object under the hood. But everyone reading QString(""hello"") thinks this is the QString(const char*) ctor and won't remotely think that the compiler will read this as QString(std::string(const char*)).",1000869,http://marcmutz.wordpress.com/2010/08/24/a-case-against-direct-initialisation-%E2%80%94-the-sequel/,marcmutz.wordpress.com,Bug report,Clarifying,External,QT

> I don't know much about ibus, is there a resson why can't we use reply.waitForFinished()? 

ibus uses dbus methods internall.
According to QTBUG-40541 (http://code.google.com/p/ibus/issues/detail?id=1726), The problem is when ibus ""ProcessKeyEvent"" method is sent with space key or Enter key, the qt module receives ""CommitText"" method during calling ""ProcessKeyEvent"".
Since ""CommitText"" is async API in ibus, if the qt module calls reply.waitForFinished(), QIBusPlatformInputContext::filterEvent() could be finished before ""CommitText"" method would be finished.
The space or Enter key can commit both the Korean pre-edit string with ""CommitText"" and space or line feed with the return of ""ProcessKeyEvent"".
If this patch is not applied, the order of the Korean pre-edit string and space is not correct.
It depends on the client QT applications how the space or Enter key handles so ibus needs to return false in ""ProcessKeyEvent"".
I tried to use sync dbus in all ibus methods but dbus could cause a timeout.
And then to avoid this problem, 
QIBusPlatformInputContext::filterEvent() needs to be async.
ibus provides ibus_input_context_process_key_event() and ibus_input_context_process_key_event_async() in ibusinputcontext.h.
QIBusPlatformInputContext::filterEvent() uses ibus_input_context_process_key_event() and use the async in this patch.
GTK+ module uses ibus_input_context_process_key_event_async(). [1]
GTK+ module also implements the environment value of ""IBUS_ENABLE_SYNC_MODE"" for the test purpose.

You can't seriously be basing your argument off of what some random documentation pages happen to say at the bottom. If all of Apple's documentation said ""Available since OS X Mountain Lion"" instead of ""Available since OS X 10.8"", would you be demanding that we need a way to compare the string ""Mountain Lion"" against others, instead of just using 10.8 like any sane person? Come on. The version is the version. You're the only person confused by this.

Besides, it's not like you're the one who will be answering support tickets asking why 6.1 is returned instead of 7 (which is beside the point, because it won't ever happen, and also beside the point because it's the responsibility of the developer to read documentation).

If we have some functions or constants labeled ""Windows8_1"" and so on, which return a QVersionNumber object with the major set to 6 and the minor set to 3, I'll be perfectly happy to provide those, and you should be perfectly fine with that scenario.",1000530,https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms724832.aspx,msdn.microsoft.com,Tutorial or article,Clarifying,External,QT

Anyone know what the Qt Continuous Integration System license failure is about?  The files it mentioned weren't part of this commit.

I can make another version using Q_GLOBAL_STATIC.
QCache sounds like a good idea, but how big of a maxCost should it use?  The default of 100 sounds like a huge number of directories to cache, but it is bounded, so maybe that would be a good option.  What do you think Olivier?

The other option is to pick one lock type for a platform and do away with this whole heuristic of trying to determine if for a given file if the two locks are actually the same underlying lock or not and hope for the best.  I did some searching and some articles advise giving up entirely on locking.  I would be just fine with using one type of lock or the other and can code it up that way, I would use fcntl POSIX by default as that's both what goes over NFS and is more portable.

I don't think it causes an ambiguity: quint32 (unsigned int), quint64 (unsigned long long), and unsigned long are three different types, and as such overloading on them is safe. 

The fact that unsigned long may represent the exact same values of either quint32 or quint64 (depending on the platform) is an implementation detail. In standard C++ pretty much all of the integrals may represent the same range...

And, therefore, having an overload for each possible unsigned type is good.

> Signed types implicitly convert to unsigned ones. That's not a problem.

I think that *is* a problem: going from signed to unsigned is not an integral promotion http://eel.is/c++draft/conv.prom , but an integral conversion http://eel.is/c++draft/conv.integral

> Sorry, I think this is ill-advised. I think kernelVersionNumber() is a great idea, but productVersionNumber() makes no sense for Windows. Using the kernel version there is a recipe for problems down the line.

It makes perfect sense for Windows, because that's what the product version number actually is. The kernel does not have a version. The whole point of this is to smooth out the inconsistency you created with productVersion(), causing everyone who wants meaningful values to have to use ifdefs to call kernelVersion() on Windows and productVersion() elsewhere.

Exactly what problems do you think this is a recipe for?

> You could document that productVersionNumber() returns an invalid version on Windows since the numbers aren't necessarily sequential and there are some versions that don't have numbers in the first place.

Those are not numbers; they are marketing names. I'd also like to know why you think the kernel version is actually the kernel version. Let me give you several examples:

1. When you open a command prompt on Windows 8.1, it says ""Microsoft Windows [Version 6.3.9600]"".

2. When you open an ""About Windows"" dialog or run winver, it says ""Microsoft Windows\nVersion 6.3 (Build 9600)"", and a logo above that says ""Windows 8"" (not actually Windows 8.1, interestingly).

3. Official Microsoft documentation at https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms724832.aspx lists the version numbers of the operating system as 6.2, 6.3, 10.0, etc. It uses the term ""operating system version"" SEVERAL times on that page, and includes the phrase ""Windows 8 OS version value (6.2)"". It never says NT or kernel version.

4. The documentation of the GetVersionEx function https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms724451.aspx explicitly states ""operating system version"" many times. It never says NT or kernel version.

5. The registry (under HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion) lists ""6.3"" as ""CurrentVersion"" (note VERSION) and ""Windows 8.1 Pro"" as ""ProductName"" (note product NAME).

The ""NT"" in the aforementioned registry key is the ONLY piece of official evidence I've found that even slightly indicates a version of the kernel. As far as I can see, the kernel does not have a version number. Please point me to a single piece of official documentation that refers to the Windows NT version number. I'll concede that browser user agents do contain ""NT"" but considering the age of Internet Explorer it's not really referring to the kernel version and contains that merely for historical reasons.

6. Python's platform() function refers to the version number (6.0, 6.1, 6.2) as ""version"" in all places, and the Windows marketing name (Vista, 7, 8) as ""release"".

7. Foundation (Objective-C / Swift) NSProcessInfo.operatingSystemVersion returns the Windows version number (5.x, 6.x, 10.x) on Windows, and the ""product"" version on Apple platforms (OS X 10.x, iOS 8.x, 9.x, ...).

8. Java's system property os.version gives me the OS X version number on OS X (10.11.4) and the Windows version number on Windows (6.3).

You should be arguing that productVersionNumber() is left as is, and kernelVersionNumber() returns an invalid QVersionNumber(), because NT does not have a version.

For Windows, the two happen to be the same. Just like it is on FreeBSD and many other operating systems. This kernel/product version number distinction is a very Linux-specific thing (and Apple, I suppose, but the kernel there is actually XNU, not Darwin).

In the section ""The Bad and the Good of Alertable I/O"" the two main concerns are

1) ""Callback functions. Alertable I/O requires that you create callback functions, which makes implementing your code much more difficult. These callback functions typically don_t have enough contextual information about a particular problem to guide you, so you end up placing a lot of information in global variables.""

This is utter nonsense. You can put contextual information into the LPOVERLAPPED that the ReadFileEx callback receives. We do that and it's not ""a horrible way to do I/O"".

2) ""Threading issues. The real big problem with alertable I/O is this: The thread issuing the I/O request must also handle the completion notification.""

This is a restriction. But it doesn't restrict our use cases at all.


Then, then main concern of http://www.flounder.com/asynchexplorer.htm is that you need to be in alertable wait state to receive data ""often enough to not loose throughput"". While this is true, please consider that Qt's event dispatcher puts us into alertable wait state *very* often.

148274,1000669,"Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

The difference between Qt4 and Qt5, is as follows. In Qt4, QApplication implemented a virtual public commitData() method (the sole point at which a commitDataRequest() signal is emitted). KApplication (subclassed from QApplication) then overrides commitData() and does not use the commitDataRequest() signal. The default Qt4 commitData() does attempt to close all app windows (just as in Qt5), but again, KApplication overrides this behavior and so the issue is not present in Qt4 (at least for KApps).

In Qt5, QApplication subclasses QGuiApplication which does not provide an overridable commitData() method, implementing it instead as the private QGuiApplicationPrivate::commitData(), where, as in Qt4, this is the sole point at which a commitDataRequest() signal is emitted. In KF5 we use QGuiApplication for apps and therefore always implicitly use QGuiApplicationPrivate::commitData() and respond to the commitDataRequest() signal emitted from it. The problem then with QGuiApplication as it is now, is that, regardless of what an app does in a slot connected to commitDataRequest(), QGuiApplicationPrivate::commitData() will always attempt to close all app windows immediately after the commitDataRequest() signal processing. Furthermore, even if a KMainWindow-based app does not act on the commitDataRequest() signal, but rather, uses the overridable queryClose() provided by KMainWindow, if window closure is accepted, windows will still be closed prematurely, ie, before the window manager does its session saving.

So, to summarize, it appears to me that both the Qt4 and Qt5 default behavior of closing windows on session shutdown is undesirable (as noted, the issue doesn't occur in KDE4 because the behavior was overridded). To me, then, in Qt5 it seems to be more appropriate to imploy the commitDataRequest() signal without any associated window closures and let the session manager itself do this.

In regards to this set of patches, then, while it is surely a possible strategy to fix the problem, it seems to be overkill/overly-complicated. Instead, quite some time ago, I proposed simply removing the window closures from QGuiApplicationPrivate::commitData() (see https://codereview.qt-project.org/#/c/140115), and fixing session management in KF5 as required (see https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=346768, and the associated patches, https://bugs.kde.org/attachment.cgi?id=95380 and https://bugs.kde.org/attachment.cgi?id=95381.",1001197,https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=346768,bugs.kde.org,Bug report,Elaborating,External,QT

I agree with C H but think you could go even further. I think it would be a good idea to re-purpose the patch to instead first check for /.flatpak-info, then check for /run/user/$UID/flatpak-info, else return false.

The manpage (https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/blob/master/doc/flatpak-metadata.xml#L49-L55) says

            A metadata file describing the effective configuration is available
            inside the running sandbox at <filename>/.flatpak-info</filename>.
            For compatibility with older Flatpak versions,
            <filename>/run/user/$UID/flatpak-info</filename> is a symbolic

Very good idea and thanks for getting this started. I also like the q+Capital names because we may want to make those functions public -- called from QString and QStringView inline functions.

That said, a little bit of micro-optimisation:
* the functions called from qstring.cpp should be the static ones, not the non-static ones. That's because, the moment we Q_CORE_EXPORT them, the call becomes indirect via the PLT.
* as discussed in the comment, I'd prefer a (ptr,ptr) iterator range or (ptr,size_t) instead of QStringView.

Looks like, despite ""the value of passing by value"", that there is one major architecture that would pass QStringView (as it currently stands, without my changes!) by reference in the stack: Windows 64-bit. So you shuold pass QStringView by value where the API calls for QStringView, but please don't use QStringView in the low-level API.

The difference between Qt4 and Qt5, is as follows. In Qt4, QApplication implemented a virtual public commitData() method (the sole point at which a commitDataRequest() signal is emitted). KApplication (subclassed from QApplication) then overrides commitData() and does not use the commitDataRequest() signal. The default Qt4 commitData() does attempt to close all app windows (just as in Qt5), but again, KApplication overrides this behavior and so the issue is not present in Qt4 (at least for KApps).

In Qt5, QApplication subclasses QGuiApplication which does not provide an overridable commitData() method, implementing it instead as the private QGuiApplicationPrivate::commitData(), where, as in Qt4, this is the sole point at which a commitDataRequest() signal is emitted. In KF5 we use QGuiApplication for apps and therefore always implicitly use QGuiApplicationPrivate::commitData() and respond to the commitDataRequest() signal emitted from it. The problem then with QGuiApplication as it is now, is that, regardless of what an app does in a slot connected to commitDataRequest(), QGuiApplicationPrivate::commitData() will always attempt to close all app windows immediately after the commitDataRequest() signal processing. Furthermore, even if a KMainWindow-based app does not act on the commitDataRequest() signal, but rather, uses the overridable queryClose() provided by KMainWindow, if window closure is accepted, windows will still be closed prematurely, ie, before the window manager does its session saving.

So, to summarize, it appears to me that both the Qt4 and Qt5 default behavior of closing windows on session shutdown is undesirable (as noted, the issue doesn't occur in KDE4 because the behavior was overridded). To me, then, in Qt5 it seems to be more appropriate to imploy the commitDataRequest() signal without any associated window closures and let the session manager itself do this.

I looked into the siblingIndex and I don't believe we can use it. The siblingIndex of all the items in a scene is not unique. Imagine a scene that has three top level items (A, B, and C) and that item C has three children (X, Y, and Z). If the items were inserted in that order, the siblingIndex of these items is A=0, B=1, C=2, X=0, Y=1, Z=2. This is what's ensured by QGraphicsItemPrivate::ensureSequentialSiblingIndex(). If I now delete item B, I cannot use its siblingIndex value to correctly update the linear index, since B and Y have the same siblingIndex. The linear index requires an index that is unique for each item in the scene, and in the presence of hierarchies, siblingIndex is not unique. The code you wrote for removeItem() and addItem() is valid for scenes with top-level items only. Not to mention that there are methods that update the siblingIndex of an item, so we'll need to also adjust these to somehow notify the linear index about the changes. I don't see a working solution there.

In general the problem with using a free indices approach is that there is no way to quickly get the indices. A search over the list is slow and any other approach would require extra memory that maps an item to an index.

Since you asked, here is some info about my application: It has a single top-level item that contains all the other items in a deep, fairly well distributed hierarchy. Every single item fully contains its children in its bounding rectangle. Initially I used the default BSP index, but once I started playing with a big number of items, that index became a huge bottleneck. It is really slow to create and maintain. Take the chips demo for example, on my machine it takes a few seconds to start it when using the BSP index, whereas with the linear index, it is instant. And this is just 40 000 items, with millions the slowdown is unacceptable. Moreover I really don't need the BSP index, as my items fully contain their children, the default indexer implementation is very efficient. Regarding memory consumption, the 58MB are irrelevant for my application, since with so many items it already consumes 1.71 GB of ram. In case you're interested, the application is an early prototype of a visual IDE which I'm developing for my PhD, you can checkout some videos here: http://dimitar-asenov.github.io/Envision/",1002276,http://dimitar-asenov.github.io/Envision/,dimitar-asenov.github.io,Software homepage,Elaborating,External,QT

Hi,

the previous bug I opened, were related to mix between mkspecs, pkgconfig and default variables used in *.pro files for testing features lire EGL in configure.

Your correction seems to force the use of mkspecs for pi and pi2. I don't know then if pi0 and pi3 are handled.

I'm also not sure that the *.pc files are too buggy since the correction that Yocto brought seems to have reached raspberrypi seeing this link:
https://github.com/raspberrypi/userland/tree/master/pkgconfig

Are those *.pc files really buggy to you?

The point would be to be able to use them without getting trouble. I found a quick patch used in Qt-5.7 in metat-qt5 but it's definitely not the best neither. I heard that the configure part has changed in Qt-5.8. I'll check it now.

I appreciate your feedback. Here are some uses of PATCH:

Rails 4.0 (released in June) uses PATCH as the default method for resource updates:
http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2012/2/25/edge-rails-patch-is-the-new-primary-http-method-for-updates/

Hey Samuel. I took a look at what QStandardPaths produces on iOS8, and it's unfortunately different that iOS7, which this patch is based on. In iOS8, the files live inside the App's Data container (https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/FileSystemProgrammingGuide/FileSystemOverview/FileSystemOverview.html) which has the path /var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/7C218B37-1A75-428A-A7D3-8EFAC9CB07FD/. The App bundle lives in /Containers/Bundle/Application/582C0349-3A5E-4487-A7D2-5753F7193270/texteditor.app. 

I think adding multiple versions of the paths will just make things noisy and confusing. We should probably have a section about what the app and data containers are, and that they can live in different places depending on OS version. With that in mind I think this patch should be deferred until 5.5.

Part of the reason I say that, is that I also noticed the OSX documentation (and implementation) is wrong for App Store sandboxed apps, so this whole doc needs a bit of a revamp. For the code, we're also using old Carbon APIs for OSX, while iOS uses new (but available on OSX) Foundation APIs. For 5.5 we should merge these two code paths.",1000032,https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/FileSystemProgrammingGuide/FileSystemOverview/FileSystemOverview.html,developer.apple.com,Tutorial or article,Elaborating,External,QT

My argument is like this:
* the OS does not support environment variables. If you don't like it, please use http://connect.microsoft.com to voice your displeasure.
* more importantly, that means we cannot get environment variables set from the outside. That means the only variables that are ever set in our environment are those as a result of qputenv.
* qputenv will not affect child processes as there's no way to communicate that information to them, nor will it affect non-Qt code as it will have no access to our fake environment. Quite a few unit tests that use qputenv expect this to work, which it cannot ever work. Therefore, if we ever want those tests to pass on WinCE/RT, they will need to be fixed by other means.

There are only two cases of qputenv in library code that gets compiled to CE/RT:
* qtmain_winrt.cpp, with result of __getmainargs (see https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff770599.aspx). Since there is no external environment on WinRT, this is probably dead code and can be safely removed.
* qtestcase.cpp, setting QT_LOGGING_TO_CONSOLE=1 and QT_QTESTLIB_RUNNING=1. The latter is only used on OS X and presumably would be used by child processes. Clearly that wouldn't work.

That leaves only one valid use of qputenv: to control our own library features from unit tests. To accommmodate that, I think it's best to move the fake environment code to qglobal.cpp and remove the wrapper functions that exist in qfunctions_win{ce,rt}.h, as https://codereview.qt-project.org/143423 does.

The only remaining question is whether we provide it always or whether we provide it only in developer-build mode.

I would propose for developer build mode only. I don't think it's Qt's business to provide this functionality when the platform vendor thought people didn't need it. The vendor specifically and intentionally removed support for a function mandated by ISO C.

UBSan produces binaries which are an order of magnitude larger than a normal release build. At least on GCC all the way up to and including 6.1, UBSan doesn't work with PCH (https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=66343), so my 4-core + HT laptop takes several (as in two-digit) hours to build qt5.git... excluding QtWebkit and some other modules.

Then you need the very latest GCC to avoid the exponential behaviour when compiling a qxmlpatterns test (https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=70342).

I don't think this is ready for use in a CI, yet, but it's a worthy goal.

We also started with well over 4000 ubsan errors in qtbase alone. It's down to around 1000 now (both numbers excluding the network tests). To be meaningful, we need to get that down much more, and in other modules, too, before we deploy to the CI.

normal reference and rvalue reference are not supported as metatype.
This treat the const reference as the same as the naked type, since that is how we thread them for signals and slots.

The reason behind this change is that it fixes the problem where the metatype of const reference was not properly detected with the new syntax.  I originaly made another fix for it inside qobject_impl.h
 http://paste.kde.org/665210/   But then I decided that we could have it directly in QMetaType instead.

The normalized signature of the type  ""const QString &""  is ""QString""    That's why i think it make sens to also return the same metatype id.

Non const reference are not supported in Queued signals slots anyway.
An rvalue references are not even allowed in signals or slot at all, the moc generated code would fail to compile.  It also would not make much sens at all, since you are supposed to connect to many slots, how can you pass a temporary there ?",1000328,http://paste.kde.org/665210/,paste.kde.org,Others,Providing Context,External,QT

I have tested the patch and it seems to work. 

I have only two questions though:

1) Should these hover events also respect setMouseTracking(false)? I would expect them to behave in the same way as mouse events.

2) [probably unrelated] When using evdev tablets, the pressure is not always updated correctly. If you press quick enough, then the pressure may stop at 0.987 instead of 1.0. And when releasing too quickly, it may freeze at 0.12. It looks like some of the pressure updates events are lost.

Yes, but the problem is that the garbled output is the same as the output from another garbled string. For example, a gamma would show up the same as an alpha (just a ""?""), so you can't tell whether the user intended to keep the same or if there was a change, which also garbled.

I have tested this patch. The touch device is recognized as a touch device, but I still get no touch event im my app.

No, it is hopeless, in practice we have given up on getting things working sanely out of the box on all RPi distros out there since you never know which graphics stacks a particular distro is shipping and what the libEGL/GLESv2 we want is called.

We also need to take care of some level of background compatibility since customers won't jump to newer versions just because somebody decides to rename libEGL again, or introduces an unusable alternative graphics stack.

You probably won't be surprised to hear that the upstream blob repo (https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware) recently changed the approach *again*, this time going for a side-by-side approach where the Broadcom stack is called libbrcmEGL, libbrcmGLESv2, etc. with no telling what libEGL/libGLESv2 (if those are symlinks even) and the pkg-config entries point to. (and no idea how and where the Mesa binaries would be shipped and what that would be called)

Distros and distro building tools (Yocto) are free to modify this of course, some may not have /opt/vc/lib at all, etc.

One fine day it will all be simple, once Mesa's RPi support matures and it becomes the primary graphics stack, and we can forget about the Broadcom stack. Then RPi distros won't be any different from a usual desktop distro in this respect. Until then I suggest not to spend valuable time on this mess.

""But how can the URL work if it is truncated? Won't it fail to load the PAC then and (depending on the network) then have the network request fail?""

It's not the URL to the PAC file that's truncated, it's the URL to determine a proxy for.

In our scenario we follow redirects in a SAML redirect binding (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAML_2.0#HTTP_Redirect_Binding). The URLs in that case get pretty large, i.e. about 2700 characters long. Performing a HTTP GET to such an URL fails on Windows with PAC configuration.

The weird thing is, that letting the browser perform the GET works (IE, chrome). So I assume the browser truncates the URL before calling WinHttpGetProxyForUrl.

The idea was to make it convenient to cross build on a multiarch platform[1], or when using a multiarch chroot. The specific use case
for this is cross compilation of Qt for Ubuntu touch/phone.
This is Debian/Ubuntu specific, and afaik, it's the only place where it's possible to somewhat relay on a consistent
use of the triplet in binaries and library paths. The DEFAULT_MULTIARCH_SYSROOT variable can be removed, since
it's redundant, however I still need the triplet for setting up the rpath-link paths.

I used the CROSS_COMPILE value as that's what I understood, from your previous comment, was the preferred way. I can__ see that it__ required that the CROSS_COMPILE variable is in the __in-prefix_ format though, but to be honest i don__ find the name __ROSS_COMPILE_ to be very descriptive, so I would prefer something else.

@psychon (a.k.a Uli Schlachter) who is a maintainer of Awesome WM has a good comment regarding the situation with the standard [1].

If year was 2010, I would also suggest that this should be resolved upstream. But now with linux desktop slowly getting ready for wayland:

1) upstream won't care about this;
2) if I am wrong and upstream will care about resolving this, by the time this would be supported by WMs, it wouldn't really matter anymore;
